# Competitive-Programming
This repository contains a significant amount of my solutions to competitive problems i've faced, and it's divided into sections - 

2022 (not sorted) - mostly (accepted) solutions to cses problems, although it's a relatively a small part of the total solutions i've (overall i've solved 101 problems, you may peek at my profile, link in bio). there are some solutions there for codeforces problems (again, a small chunck - link in bio for all solutions).
There were many solutions to problems given during training in Israel's national cs teams, but I shouldn't post them here in order to maintain their privacy :)

2023 (sorted) - after a break from comp programming for a few months, i've returned to the field several weeks ago (due to the time of writing) and started 
solving comp programming problems, again. 
I've started with some leetcode, then moved to codeforces, and currently solving USACO problems (from past contests & those from the guide, almost all are gold sectioned).
